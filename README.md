# vmware-kms

vmware-kms, is based on excellent [PyKMIP](https://github.com/OpenKMIP/PyKMIP) Project, and inspired from [lamw/vmwkmip](https://hub.docker.com/r/lamw/vmwkmip) docker image.
the principal difference, is on persistent storage, and availability to backup keys.

it must be not used on production environments, due to lack of security, but ideal for labs or pre-prod infrastrucutres.
